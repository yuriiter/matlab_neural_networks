# Matlab nerual networks

Here are matlab neural network projects that I made during study at university.
This is the list:
- Points classification
- Function approximation
- Heart illness detection

## Points classification
In the program, I created an MLP network to classify points into 5 classes. We have a dataset of points, based on which the net trains. In the end, we test the network with 5 custom poins.

## Function approximation
In this project, we have a dataset of points that define some nonlinear function, train the network based on them and see the result.

## Heart illness detection
This one is a practical task. We have a dataset of real researches, the aim is to determine the type of arrhythmia from the ECG recordings. This database contains 279 attributes, 206 of which are linear valued and the rest are nominal. The number of instances is 452.
